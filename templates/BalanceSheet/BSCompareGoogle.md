Balance Sheet Compare Template Example
--
The following is the link to a google doc that uses the xbrlValues api to build a lease worksheet that creates a normalized balance sheet.  The template shows how XBRL data has to be normalized to perform comparison. This template should be copied using the menu item File/Make a copy. This sheet has  custom functions that fetch the data from the API and cache the data and allow the user to select certain data returned from the XML string returned.
