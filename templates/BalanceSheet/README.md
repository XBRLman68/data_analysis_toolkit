# Balance Sheet Templates
Use the links to the Balance Sheet template in either Google Sheets or Excel (requires Excel version
2013) which uses the xbrlValues api, to extract balance sheet items for multiple companies. To
customize, use the green cells to change ticker symbol and time periods requested.
