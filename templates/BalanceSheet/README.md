# Balance Sheet Templates
Use the links to the Balance Sheet template in either Google Sheets (there may be a limit on the number of requests you can make
using a single Google Sheet but the sheet can be copied to create new sheets) or Excel (requires Excel version
2013) which uses the xbrlValues api, to extract balance sheet items for multiple companies. To
customize, use the green cells to change ticker symbol and time periods requested.
