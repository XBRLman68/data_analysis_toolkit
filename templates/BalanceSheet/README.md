# Balance Sheet Templates

Google Sheet and Excel versions of the balance sheet template linked here can be used for your analysis by doing the following: 1) create a copy of the google sheet for your own purposes and save locally, 2) insert a valid API key in the sheet; keys are freely available from XBRL US at http://xbrl.us/apirequest. The demo sheet contains a temporary API that will expire each week. Copy your own key into the cell to replace the temporary API key, 3) to customize the analysis, change the green cells for ticker symbol and time periods requested.

Important: Note that the Excel sheet requires at minimum, Excel version 2013; for the Google sheet, there is a limit of 20,000 requests per day that you can make but again, the sheet can be copied to accommodate further data requests. Most data on these sheets is driven by the XBRL US database.
