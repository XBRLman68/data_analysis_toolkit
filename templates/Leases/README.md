# Leases Templates
Use the links to the Google doc sheet (there may be a limit on the number of requests you can make
using a single Google Sheet but the sheet can be copied to create new sheets ) or the Excel worksheet
(requires Excel version 2013) to perform company-specific lease analysis.. Both worksheets use the
xbrlValues api to build a lease worksheet that calculates the adustments to account for an operating
lease in the same manner as a capitalized lease. The template shows how the lease payments and
discount rates can be extracted from XBRL data. Content in these worksheets is driven by the XBRL US
database and other sources, and can be customized by the user. To perform custom analysis on either
worksheet, change content in green cells to update ticker symbol, time period or taxonomy elements
selected, e.g., OperatingLeasesFutureMinimumPaymentsDueCurrent. Content in pink cells is reported
XBRL data or calculated from XBRL data.
