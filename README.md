# data_analysis_toolkit
This toolkit provides API and Template resources to help you access and begin analyzing corporate XBRL
data. Through the tools provided, you’ll have easy access to the XBRL US database which contains all
public company data reported in XBRL format, updated approximately every 15 minutes from the SEC’s
EDGAR system.

The **API folder** includes several APIs that allow users to fetch XBRL facts from the database in an XML
format, by requesting financial statement parameters such as CIK or accession number, time period or
US GAAP concept, to define the data returned.

The **Templates folder** provides standardized worksheets in Google Sheets and Excel that focus on a type
of analysis such as analyzing or performing comparative company analysis. These sheets can be
customized to perform similar analysis on different publicly traded companies, at a specific point in
time. Any green cell within a Sheet can be revised to access a different set of data. Pink cells contain
reported or calculated data from XBRL or other sources. New sheets will be posted here periodically and
users of this site are encouraged to post their own templates and to check back from time to time to
find new content.

All APIs and templates require use of a valid XBRL US API key which is freely available at http://xbrl.us/APIkey.
